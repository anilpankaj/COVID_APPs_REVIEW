Update: Since I haven't heard of a single case being tracked with this app it turned out to be a huge waste of time and taxpayer money.

It keeps telling me ever couple of months that my phone number has expired then when I try to cancel my number most times I have to send in 5-10 requests before it works. And like today it told me I am not connected to a network for internet access when I am so I turned it off and back on again and still not connected so deleted app reinstated app but now it's saying the same thing about my number being expired. I only redid this November last year so not even 12mths like they say Heap of beep!,1,2022-03-09 03:11:03

For an app that Dosen't work and counts you as a close contact if you've been next to someone with covid for more than 4 hours (health advice says differently)! This app uses a lot of power. From one charge this app uses 4percent of my power whilst google uses 3percent and is a far more demanding app than something which is just supposed to use bluetooth. This app was the biggest waste of 65 million dollars I can think of. UNINSTALLED!,1,2022-01-26 11:41:07

This app has proven itself to be ineffective. I've received zero alerts despite knowing that I've been a close contact with a number of covid cases. No official has ever asked that I upload my data nor anyone else I know who has tested positive - that speaks volumes about this inefficient top down approach! This app relies on manual contact tracing which is no longer being done. Perhaps the Google-Apple covid tracing technology would have been a better choice if the government had allowed it.,1,2022-01-20 21:45:12

Haven't any reason to like or dislike but don't how purposefull it really is. Not done me any favours.,1,2021-11-12 06:47:55
Would be good if it would update,1,2021-11-12 06:46:54
Great,5,2021-11-12 06:42:51
"In comparison with the blistering fast app they have in South Australia ours is an absolute shocker. As soon as you start to take your phone out of your pocket and it faces even slightly towards the QR code it fires off instantly, unlike ours where you can stand there for what seems ages waving the box over the code.",1,2021-11-12 06:36:59

Just read all the negative reviews what is wrong with them. Anti vac's I assume wait till they are going to be put on ventilators begging for a vaccination. 100% marks to all involved tracing contacts etc keeping us qlders safe.,5,2021-11-12 06:05:43
App is of no use to me,1,2021-11-12 06:03:50
Useless,1,2021-11-12 05:21:10
Do we really need this app. I think it's just pointless,2,2021-11-12 03:02:16
As soon as i download app i get 5 scams per day,1,2021-11-12 02:04:27
What a load of codswallop. The cases are fake. Someone got shot dead and was added to the death. When will you lot wake up. Negative stars if that was possible.,1,2021-11-12 01:23:24

This app has contributed nothing! A total waste of time! Representing the governments contribution as half cocked and a day late throughout!,1,2021-11-12 00:12:35
Can't check in with this. I can't find the app I need because of all the side apps.,1,2021-11-11 23:20:53
Pointless app,1,2021-11-11 21:59:02
It's a very usual tool,5,2021-11-11 11:20:33
Just uninstalled as it said it looks like I was in another country and would not update ... very suspect ... wondered why my battery was running low and after reading other reviews ... this useless app was probably responsible !!,1,2021-11-11 10:03:30
Have never used it. Appears totally useless,1,2021-11-11 07:45:08

"This is more evidence that the federal and state governments are completely corrupt. Humans will adapt to viruses as with the Spanish flu. All decisions being made are solely political, not medical. Medical aspect is purely to instill fear.",1,2021-11-11 00:40:04

Another tool in the fight against Covid-19 and easy to use.,5,2021-11-10 10:40:48
Has this ever been used to track. Why do we need this now,1,2021-11-10 10:08:48

Excellent app,5,2021-11-10 10:07:34

"Good when it works. I have problems with the app pausing before loading and then starting with a screen to enter email and password, which I can't remember! I am not the only one I know who has this problem. It is very frustrating - rights itself after a while without any input from me.",4,2021-11-10 08:41:26
All good,5,2021-11-10 08:31:32
"Bit of a dud. The information sharing is useful (hence 1 star) but actual operation seems pointless. Consumes significant portion of my battery charge each day, so not environmentally friendly at all either.",1,2021-11-10 08:28:15
"Used this app from the start but it's been difficult. It's disruptive to WiFi and Bluetooth, also would regularly cease ruining. Overall the experience wasn't predominantly negative, but looking back it feels like I wasted my time installing it, especially since I now have to sign in twice when entering a store or public site.",2,2021-11-10 08:26:48
Seems like a total waste of time. Only did it because of Govt. & Medical urging.,1,2021-11-10 08:23:52

Completely Useless. Covid passes on in seconds. This app wont even recognise that sick person unless they been near you for 15min,1,2021-11-10 08:18:02

Ease of use,5,2021-11-10 08:09:05
What was the point of this app? Scomo's mates needed a goverment contract? F for fail,1,2021-11-10 08:08:50
